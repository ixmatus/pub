* Welcome!
  =Pub= builds two utilities for piping to and from a redis pub/sub
  channel and stdout/stdin.

** Install
   Right now, you gotta compile it.

** Examples

*** Using pub
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    tail -F /some/log/file | grep "logfileProperty" | pub "logline"
    #+END_SRC

*** Using sub
    #+BEGIN_SRC
    sub "logline" | grep "somethingspecific"
    #+END_SRC
